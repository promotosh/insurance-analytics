The project employs multiple statistical methods to uncover key correlations and assesses the stability of these patterns across different time points and geographical segments. By leveraging comprehensive data analysis and advanced statistical techniques, this repository aims to provide actionable insights into customer behavior and help the management make informed decisions to improve renewal rates.
